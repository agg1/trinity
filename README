patched trintiy gentoo overlay

- compilation of most of the meta packages succeeded on latest gentoo ~amd64
- patches folder contains patches applied which are not ready for clean integration yet
- minor adaptions for libressl and musl libc were required
- dbus was removed entirely, as a consequence kdm is not supported (and not required anyway)
